<div class="paragraph width">
        <p>I'm a web developer looking for full-time, contract or freelance opportunities.  I have experience creating personal websites from scratch using html, css and javascript .</p>    
  
        <p>Prior to launching my career as a web developer, I spent 15 years as a technical recruiter specializing in finding software engineers for tech companies.  I spent five years at Facebook's Seattle engineering site first as a university recruiter and later managing a team of recruiters.  During that time I was steeped in Facebook's move fast culture.  I continue to carry those values with me as I work to build creative and highly functional projects.
